	<p>Hi Rob Lewis1,

Welcome to Microsoft Community.

I can understand that something like this is upsetting. When creating a Microsoft account, puzzles are created to verify that the creator is a real person and not a robot. This is set for safety, please understand.

Below are instructions and suggestions for puzzle verification:

First of all, most of the puzzle is to select the correct picture according to the specified word in 9 boxes. If you are sure that you have selected all the correct picture but the verification fails, please deliberately choose a wrong picture and let the verification refresh to change the different specified word, some pictures may be difficult to recognize.

Others are mathematical algorithms and choosing objects with different directions between multiple objects. Both of these puzzles are usually simple (with a clear answer), and if you get an incorrect answer, it is recommended that you try a different network connection (such as a mobile hotspot) and try again.

If you come across a puzzle that you're not sure about, send me the screenshots and I can help you see which puzzles (of this type) to choose from.

Finally, I will feed back your questions to the development department, and we will continue to provide better user experience.

Thanks for your patience and understanding!

Best Regards,

Manson | Microsoft Community Support Specialist</p>
